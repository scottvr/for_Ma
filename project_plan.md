### **2\. Task Breakdown by Phase**

#### **Phase 1: MVP (6 weeks)**

**Week 1-2**:  
**Task: Email Listener Setup & Mention Detection**

*   Develop the listener system to monitor incoming emails (e.g., in Gmail, Outlook).
*   Implement the functionality to detect `@mentions` of EmailGPT.
*   Set up a simple email interface for logging and testing initial communication.

**Week 3-4**:  
**Task: Response Generation Using GPT**

*   Integrate GPT-4 for basic response generation based on the parsed mentions.
*   Test initial task extraction from emails and link parsed data to GPT responses.
*   Start basic feedback loop implementation (e.g., recognizing commands like "mute").

**Week 5-6**:  
**Task: Short-Term Context Management & Command Feedback**

*   Implement short-term memory for EmailGPT, allowing it to retain context within a single thread.
*   Finalize the feedback loop mechanism, ensuring commands like "mute" and "unmute" work consistently.
*   Test the MVP with internal stakeholders.

**Milestone**:  
By the end of Week 6, EmailGPT should have:

*   The ability to detect mentions, generate basic responses, and handle a simple command feedback loop.
*   The capacity to retain thread context within a limited scope.

* * *

#### **Phase 2: Enhancements (7-13 weeks)**

**Week 7-10**:  
**Task: Advanced Context Management**

*   Implement long-term memory and context tracking across extended conversations using vector databases or in-memory storage solutions.
*   Develop more sophisticated methods of recalling relevant information from past emails within the same conversation thread.

**Week 11-12**:  
**Task: Style Matching**

*   Create an NLP module that detects and mimics the tone of the email thread (formal, informal, technical, etc.).
*   Test the accuracy of tone matching and adjust as needed to ensure EmailGPT’s responses fit naturally into the conversation.

**Week 13**:  
**Task: Dynamic Expertise Level Control**

*   Implement user-configurable expertise levels in EmailGPT’s responses (e.g., junior, intermediate, senior).
*   Ensure users can issue commands to change the expertise level mid-thread if needed.

**Milestone**:  
By the end of Week 13, EmailGPT should be capable of:

*   Retaining long-term context across threads.
*   Matching the tone and style of conversations.
*   Adjusting the depth and expertise level of its responses dynamically.

* * *

#### **Phase 3: Optional Features (14-16 weeks)**

**Week 14-15**:  
**Task: Task Templates**

*   Implement a system for recognizing when pre-configured task templates (e.g., scheduling a meeting, conducting research) should be used.
*   Develop a template library for common business tasks and test integration with the GPT response generator.

**Week 16**:  
**Task: Automatic Summarization**

*   Implement functionality to summarize long email chains or extract key points for briefing team members.
*   Test the accuracy of summaries and refine the output to ensure readability and relevance.

**Milestone**:  
By the end of Week 16, EmailGPT should be able to:

*   Detect and use task templates for common requests.
*   Summarize lengthy email threads or provide concise bullet points for ease of review.

* * *

### **3\. Task Dependencies and Deliverables**

#### **Core Dependencies**:

1.  **Email Server Access**:
    
    *   Ensure access to Gmail, Outlook, or other targeted email platforms.
    *   Setup for IMAP/SMTP or API integration.
2.  **NLP and AI Libraries**:
    
    *   GPT-4 (or similar) for generating responses.
    *   NLP frameworks (e.g., spaCy or Hugging Face) for text parsing and style matching.
3.  **Database for Context Storage**:
    
    *   In-memory data storage for short-term thread context.
    *   Vector database for long-term conversation tracking (e.g., Pinecone, Faiss).

#### **Deliverables**:

*   **MVP (Week 6)**:
    *   Email parsing, basic response generation, and feedback loop.
*   **Enhancements (Week 13)**:
    *   Advanced context management, tone/style matching, expertise level control.
*   **Optional Features (Week 16)**:
    *   Task templates and email summarization.
