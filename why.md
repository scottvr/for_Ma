## What Problem Are We Solving?

In the current corporate landscape, communication overload is a significant challenge. Employees are inundated with emails, leading to confusion, miscommunication, and wasted time as they search for information across lengthy threads or switch between disparate applications. While services like ChatGPT and Claude provide valuable insights, they require users to adopt new workflows that can be disruptive and inefficient.
